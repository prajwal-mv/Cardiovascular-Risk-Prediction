Heart disease is one the major cause of moribity and mortality globally. A heart attack happens when the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a section of heart muscle suddenly becomes blocked and the heart can’t get oxygen. If blood flow isn’t restored quickly, the section of heart muscle begins to die.

Doctors and Scientists across the globe have started to look into Machine Learning Techniques to develop screening tools.

In this project, we shall be giving you a walk through on the development of a screening tool for predicting whether a patient has a 10-year risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD) based on their present health conditions using different Machine Learning Techniques.
